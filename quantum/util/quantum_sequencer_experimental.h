/// @class Sequencer.
/// @brief Implementation of a key-based task sequencing with quantum.
/// @tparam SequenceKey Type of the key based that sequenced tasks are associated with
/// @tparam Hash Hash-function used for storing instances of SequenceKey in hash maps
/// @tparam KeyEqual The equal-function used for storing instances of SequenceKey in hash maps
/// @tparam Allocator The allocator used for storing instances of SequenceKey in hash maps
/// @note The interfaces of quantum::experimental::Sequencer and quantum::Sequencer are the same. The major difference
/// between their functionalities is that quantum::experimental::Sequencer does not rely on quantum::Dispatcher to order tasks
/// based on their interdependence. In contrast, quantum::experimental::Sequencer manages task ordering itself
/// by construcing a DAG of pending tasks. In quantum::experimental::Sequencer, a task is pushed into quantum::Dispatcher
/// only when it's ready to be executed (i.e. when it has no pending dependents). This typically results
/// in executing scheduled tasks faster (w.r.t. quantum::Dispatcher) and wasting fewer CPU cycles in
/// quantum::Dispatcher.
/// @note Due to the fact that tasks enqueued to Sequencer do not get sent to quantum::Dispatcher right away,
/// no enqueue/enqueueAll method of Sequencer returns an instance of ThreadContextPtr. An important goal
/// of ThreadContextPtr returned by quantum::Dispather::post(...) calls is exception marshalling i.e.
/// notifing the caller of an exception thrown in a coroutine. Sequencer uses the exception-callback
/// mechanism instead. A user can specify an exception callback (see SequencerConfiguration<...>::getExceptionCallback)
/// that will be called whenever a task posted to Sequencer::enqueue/enqueueAll throws an exception. The opaque
/// parameter can be used to distinguish one task from another.
